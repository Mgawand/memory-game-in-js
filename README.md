# Game of concentration

The game of concentration involves a board containing an even number of squares. Each square in the grid has a color that matches another square in the board. However, the color of all squares are hidden. The goal of the game is to match the color of each square with it's matching pair.

Once the game starts, the player clicks on any square within the grid. Once clicked, the square will reveal it's hidden color.

The player then has the opportunity to reveal the color of another square. If the color of the second square matches the color of the first square, a match is made. If not, the colors of the two squares return to hidden and the player tries again.

To review the rules of gameplay: a player reveals the color of two squares at a time. If the color of the chosen squares are the same, a match is made. If not, the color of the square return to hidden. The game is won when the player matches every square with it's matching pair in the board.

# If You Get Stuck
Getting stuck when coding (and debugging) is a natural part of the programming process. If you find yourself stuck on a problem or lost, pause for a moment and take a breath. Maybe take a walk. Then retrace your steps (in the tutorial, not the walk). Make sure you've followed each step of the tutorial. It's easy to make typos or accidentally skip over important steps.
